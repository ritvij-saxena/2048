# 2048 Game

## Why?
Cause I got bored and I was like, sure why not?

## What is this?
A simple 2048 game built using Pygame. Move the tiles, merge them, and try to reach 2048.

## How to Play?
- Use Arrow Keys to move tiles.
- When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one.
- Keep going until you reach 2048 (or lose trying).
- Press R to restart if you win or lose.

## How to Run?
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame-ce
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Enjoy.
